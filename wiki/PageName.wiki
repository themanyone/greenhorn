#Instructions for using Greenhorn

= Usage =

./greenhorn

Displays interactive help for regular Python commands (also known as __builtins__).

./greenhorn gtk

Displays interactive help for the 'gtk' module.

= Details =

In order to display interactive help, the program must first load the module. There seems to be a bug with dynamic module loading, so modify the source to import additional modules that you may want interactive help on:

#~ import any modules you want to inspect
{{{
import sys,twitter,inspect,os,fedora
}}}
#~ global modules
{{{
import gtk
}}}

= Browsing Source Code =

This program evaluates and displays the output from the dir() command and outputs each functions .__doc__ string when tree items are clicked on. If local modules are imported, a source tab will appear, allowing you to browse source code on that item. For example:

./greenhorn self

If you use Greenhorn to inspect itself and search for any of the modules Greenhorn exports, such as entry_changed_cb, a source code tab will appear as a child. (Click the arrow and double-click on 'source' to see the listing.)
