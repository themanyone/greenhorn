#Instructions for using Greenhorn

= Using =

./greenhorn

Displays interactive help for regular Python commands (also known as __builtins__).

./greenhorn gtk

Displays interactive help for the 'gtk' module.

= Details =

In order to display interactive help, the program must first load the module. There seems to be a bug with dynamic module loading, so modify the source to import additional modules that you may want interactive help on:

#~ import any modules you want to inspect
{{{
import sys,twitter,inspect,os,fedora
}}}
#~ global modules
{{{
import gtk
}}}
